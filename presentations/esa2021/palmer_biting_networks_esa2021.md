Collaborators (maybe a Venn  diagram?)
* Complex dynamic systems: FB
* Genetics: MV, FL, JC, AR
* Mosquito Ecology: RE, IS
* Mosquito Alert team + entolab volunteers

Funding: ERC (H-MIP)

## Slide 

Core H-MIP Research Goal: 
* Provide Social-Science Perspective on the interactions between humans and mosquitos that shape mosquito-borne disease patterns

Applied questions: 
* What areas are more at risk?
* How can we best allocate mosquito control resources to reduce disease risk and disease burden?
* What are the most effective measures to reduce disease risk and disease burden

Broader questions:
* What are the qualities of human-mosquito biting networks?
* How do human and mosquito behavior shape (a) that network, (b) mosquito population dynamics, (c) people's lives, and (d) socio-ecological systems?

## Slide

This presentation discusses various steps of on going research
* How do different BN degree distributions within realm of possibility affect disease dynamic outcomes that we case about --> R0 and AR. Simple ABM approach already done 
* Based only on population distribution and mosquito population distribution, what BN degree distributions could we expect in Barcelona and what would that mean fof MBD dynamics? 
  * Use MA probs multiplied by census section populations to get expected mean bites per tract and then assemble the population and look at its distribution.
  * Put this distribution into the ABM 
* Do the same by district and then compare district risks, holding total bites and population sizes the same.

## Slide
Next steps
* Formalize ABM analysis
* incorporate human mobility patterns
* incorporate other aspects of human behavior and social structure: 
 * occupation
 * gender
 * class
 * age
 * social practices
* Estimate actual degree distributions using blood meal genetic analysis, surveys, interviews, and citizen science
 * SHOW distribution/descriptives of mean daily bites per person in Spain/Europe
 * SHOW province and municipality commuting flows
 * EXPLAIN blood meal analysis
 * Explain thinking and approach on social factors
