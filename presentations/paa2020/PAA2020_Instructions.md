# PAA2020 Instructions

Dear John Palmer,

Thank you for your patience while we worked to finalize a no-cost solution to allow you to upload and share your posters for a virtual PAA2020. The Engage Library is now available to all presenters, meeting registrants and PAA members. Please read and follow the upload instructions carefully.

Please go to the Poster Library and find the blue Upload Your Poster button on the left side. Be sure to select your poster session in from the Folder drop-down menu.

You are not limited to a PDF of your poster--you may also upload links or a brief video presentation. Viewers will be able to leave questions and comments. We ask that you try to do so by COB April 22 as the virtual meeting starts April 23.

Below is information on your session:
Paper Title: Human-Mosquito Biting Networks and the Dynamics of Mosquito-Borne Disease
Session: P10 P10 - Health and Mortality 2

To find out the status of oral sessions on the program (real time, asynchronous or canceled), please visit PAA's online or mobile app.

If you have any questions or need assistance, please email paa2020@popassoc.org.
